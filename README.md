# Job-Recommendation-System
Job Recommendation System Using Various Architecture 

People can now find their favourite jobs that they are interested in all over the world with the click of a button. We can now look for jobs in the West while sitting in India. Online job boards are an important part of the modern recruitment industry. Online sites assist candidates in connecting with various types of recruiters, but the issue of who to approach arises. In this sea of opportunities, we as newcomers to the industries become perplexed as to which job roles we should apply for.Today, we require a tool that will recommend the same and assist us in determining the best job role for us. Recruiters also require automated tools that can sort the right candidate for them in order to find the right fish. There are platforms, such as Linkedin and Guru, that filter out job profiles based on interest. The purpose of this paper is to investigate various techniques and create a recommendation system that can assist existing job recommendation systems in generating an adequate team for a given job opportunity based not only on the required competencies but also on the social compatibility of their members or friends.

In this project, we will investigate various techniques for optimising the job recommendation process. We will implement the Collaborative filtering technique, focusing on the common preferences of two or more candidates. Content-based filtering will be used, with a focus on key words. Experimenting with the hybrid filtering technique, in which we will create a hybrid tool that combines content and collaborative techniques. In addition to that, switching technique that will deliver the result based on the situation. In order to broaden our research, we will also test a graphical model in which we will focus on a specific team of a candidate or a referral of a candidate.
